# Remotely Sensing Cities and Environments {.unnumbered}

### Welcome to my CASA0023 Learning Diary

Here, I share my journey through the module CASA0023 Remotely Sensing Cities and Environments - as part of the Urban Spatial Science MSc degree in CASA, UCL (2023-24). Follow along, as I learn new techniques, review relevant research, apply the techniques in practice and reflect on the topics covered in each week.

### Background

I'm Jan, and I took this course, as I am curious to learn more about using aerial images and raster data from satellites for geospatial analysis. My experience with remote sensing, prior to taking this course was limited to a few introductory lectures about satellites and SAR imagery in a Geophysics module in my undergraduate. That is why I had a particular interest in taking this course to learn how these massive amounts of data *(so much of it is captured everyday!)*, can be used to extract valuable insights to address global issues.
