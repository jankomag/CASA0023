# Xaringan Presentation on a sensor {#sec-week2}

This week, we were introduced to Xaringan - a tool for making presentations in code.

Below is my presentation on Landsat 9

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width='40%'}
xaringanExtra::embed_xaringan(
  url = "https://jankomag.github.io/CASA0023-wk2-pres/",
  ratio = "53:40")
```
