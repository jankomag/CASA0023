# Google Earth Engine {#sec-week5}

## Summary

The Google Earth Engine (GEE) is a tool that allows for planetary scale analysis of remote sensing data. This software enables easy access of satellite data from Landsat, Sentinel and many other data products directly in the platform, using the Javascript-based code editor. The extension of the tool to Python is particularly useful with the geemap Python package [@wu2020geemap]. The data processing is done on Google's servers, which combined with the readily accessible datasets makes GEE an immensely powerful research tool.

All the operations and objects are stored on the server, and interacting with them is done by writing specific code in JS that packaged into JSON is sent to the server to execute. Using Google's servers allows for parallelisation of operations, which enables extremely large computational operations to complete in a reasonable time frame. That is why it is for example important to use map functions, rather than loops. GEE will also dynamically scale the resolution of satellite imagery, based on the request for optimal viewing.

## Applications

Use of GEE in publications has skyrocketed since 2015, overtaking the number of newly published research papers where analysis was performed using Python, R or QGIS. A review of literature utilising GEE in methodology showed the potential of GEE for global analysis and research [@velastegui2023google]. GEE has bee used in studies in disciplines ranging from earth and environmental science, social science, to engineering.

While browsing the literature, several interesting papers caught my interest. Firstly, this study by @tripathy2022global used GEE to develop the Global Flood Mapper tool, which uses SAR data accessible from within the platform to extract change in water level from images before and during a flooding event. The use of GEE enables the deployment of this methodology globally, making an accessible and powerful research tool.

Another paper by @liu2018high used GEE to map global urbanisation between 1990 and 2010, showing urban land has increased by around 43% in these years. The authors estimate it using a custom Normalized Urban Areas Composite Index from Landsat 5 data, constructed from several established indices, including NDVI, and make the dataset from this analysis publicly available. Another study used the MODIS satellite data for wildfire damage assessment for all of Australia, based on land cover classification of pre and post-fire images [@seydi2021wildfire].

## Reflections

In the practical sessions I got to use GEE for the first time, which involved loading some Landsat data and running certain operations. Playing around with the data in GEE, I certainly realised what potential it has for large-scale analysis. I added some satellite data for Melbourne and understood in practice how mosaicking is applied to multiple overlapping images, as well as applied some texture measures and PCA to the image.

Overall, it seems to me that the power of GEE for global research cannot be overestimated, as it enables truly impressive large-scale analysis to be run by anyone with internet access, for free. I previously did not realise how powerful this tool is and I cannot wait to see where this course will take me further in regards to GEE. As a sidenote, I am not a huge fan of the GUI of GEE - Google could probably do much better and I hope they do.
